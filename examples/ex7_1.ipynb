    "As we've seen there are several ways to work with graph-based data, including: SPARQL queries, graph algorithms traversals, ML embedding, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * computational costs as the graph size scales\n",
    "  * robustness when there is uncertainty or conflicting information in the graph\n",
    "  * formalism (i.e., *analytic solutions*) vs. empirical approaches (i.e., data-driven, machine learning)\n",

    "One way to visualize some of these trade-offs is in the following diagram:\n",

    "Note in the top/right corner of the diagram that a relatively formal category of graph-based approaches is called [*statistical relational learning*](https://www.cs.umd.edu/srl-book/).\n",
    "The gist is that so much of the *network analysis* that we want to perform can be describe mathematically as [*markov networks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_random_field), in terms of probabilistic models.\n",
    "Sometimes these can be quite computationally expensive; for example, hedge funds on Wall Street tend to burn lots of cloud computing on markov models.\n",
    "They are *robust* in terms of being able to work well even with lots of missing or conflicting data, and the *formalism* implies that we can infer mathematical guarantees from the analyis.\n",
    "That's quite the opposite of deep learning models, which are great at predicting sequences of things, but terrible at providing guarantees."

    "One path forward will be to combine machine learning with use of *structured knowledge* (i.e., KGs) such that we can avoid \"boiling the oceans\" with purely data-driven approaches when in so many use cases we can leverage domain expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this secton we'll consider one form of statistical relational learning called [*probabilistic soft logic*](https://psl.linqs.org/) (PSL) which is essentially a kind of \"fuzzy logic\" for graphs that has interesting computational qualities.\n",
    "Whereas many kinds of formal graph analysis (e.g., \"traveling salesman problem\") are provably hard and quite expensive in practice, PSL can be solved with a *convex optimization* (e.g., like so many machine learning algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this: we can describe \"rules\" about nodes and relations in a KG, then assign probabilities to specific instances of those rules that are found within our graph.\n",
    "If the probabilities are all *zero* then the system is consistent.\n",
    "As some of the assigned probabilities are increased, then some of the rules become inconsistent.\n",
    "How high (i.e., optimal) of a set of probabilities can we assign while still keeping the system consistent?\n",
    "Alternatively, if we apply a set of rules, then how \"far away\" (probabilistically speaking) is a graph from being logically consistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "This comes in quite handy when we want to combine *semantic technologies* and *machine learning*, or rather when we have explicit rules plus lots of empirical data.\n",
