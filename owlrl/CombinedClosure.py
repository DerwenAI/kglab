"""
The combined closure: performing *both* the OWL 2 RL and RDFS closures.

The two are very close but there are some rules in RDFS that are not in OWL 2 RL (eg, the axiomatic
triples concerning the container membership properties). Using this closure class the
OWL 2 RL implementation becomes a full extension of RDFS.

    Common subclass of the RDFS and OWL 2 RL semantic classes. All methods simply call back

    triple store.
